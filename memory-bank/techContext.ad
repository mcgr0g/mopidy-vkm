== Development tools

=== Linting / Type Checking Convention

* All linting and type checking MUST be executed using the project's environment via uv's run command.
* This ensures correct tool versions and consistent dependency resolution, avoiding conflicts with globally installed versions.
* Specifically, always run:
** `uv run ruff check .`
** `uv run pyright src/`

=== Test Execution Convention

* All tests MUST be run using `uv run pytest` to guarantee full plugin and environment integration.
* Example command:
** `uv run pytest tests/ -v`

IMPORTANT: Avoid running these tools directly with `python -m` or using globally installed versions to prevent environment inconsistencies.

== DevContainer Configuration

See <<devcontainerConfigContext.ad,devcontainerConfigContext.ad>> for specific port configuration details and networking setup.

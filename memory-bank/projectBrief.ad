= Project Brief

**mopidy-vkm** is a Mopidy extension that enables secure playback of music from VKontakte (vk.com). The project provides a fully-featured backend, VK-aware library and playback providers, a minimal web login UI, and strict credential handling — all packaged for easy deployment via Docker Compose on a NAS.
